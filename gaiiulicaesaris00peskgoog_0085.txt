to indicate that he himself had any religious belief at all. He saw* no

Crrnr. 13.

23 pontem] the construction of Caesar’s bridges is explained in my n.
to ιν. 15· Of course a bridge of much slighter texture than that which
Cacsar constructed on the Rhine would suffice for the Saone.

25 ciem intellegerent] ‘understanding as they did'.

26 ut flumen transirent] explanatory os conficerent ‘that which they
pagtgpccezryrlrplished’, etc, ‘namely the passage of the river'. See n. on

p. 8. 3 tribueret] this absolute use os tribuere is to say the least unusual:

accusative after tribueret With the present passage Kraner cs. dabat ,

seem that having intended to write this he changed his mind and sub-
stituted inagis virtute quom dolo sor non dolo, thus leaving the connexion
of the last words out insidiis niterentur rather ambiguous. See ap·
pendix.

slaughter'; it is common in the phrase ad internicionem, eg. bellum
ad internicionem gestum est. cf. 11. 28.

teneat would have been equally correct. ¹ ¹
