Care. 26—31] NOTES. 69

ao sumt ad milio CCCLX VIII] Caesar might have written fuit
¹ agreeing withsummo, but has preferred to make the verb agree with
fitstlztasltltl¹tliflitiis? ttl‘httltht⁶=⁶thttl”tt
11. 33 occisis od hominum milibus IV.

eorum numerus...mile'um] nuorerrrs here like sumnia above is

followed by two genitives: ‘the number of those who...was found to
consist of rroooo'.

Crine. 30.

23 totius fere Galliae] Caesar probably means Keltic Gaul.

a 5 Helvetiorum iniuriis populi Romam] Helvetiorum is the subiective,
populi Romani the objective, genitive after iniuriis: ‘injuries inflicted
by the Helvetii on the Roman people’. Cf. 31 Ariovisti iniuria ‘injury
done by Ariovistus ’, so v. ao z'rziurio Cassivellauni.

oy ex usu accidisse] it should be noticed that accidere is not always used
of unfavourable events, though it will generally be found to denote an
unsoreseen or unfortunate occurrence. Cf. 1v. aa satis opportune aeci·
desse ,⁶ Cic. Ep. Att. 1. 5 omnio quoe iucundo accidere possunt occide·
bant. With ex usu cf. such phrases as ex re, ex sententio, erepublica,
etc-r ex utilitate is not found in the classical period (Driger).

terroe Galliae] lit. ‘the land Gaul'‚ Galliae being not dependent
on, but in apposition to, terrue; so Mores Iuro, Rhenus flumen, etc.

28 florentissimas rebus] ‘thou'gh their power was at its height '.

30 locumque...iudr'cossent] ‘and to select out of so wide an area such a
place for habitation as they should judge to be most suitable and most
fertile in (out of) the whole of Gaul '.

p. 17. 1 Caesaris voluntate] not' only did they ask for permission to
hold such an assembly, but they wished also to have Caesar's approval.

4 concilio] ‘for the assembly’: contrast with the dative here V11.a
tempore erus reo constituto. ,

Cuia. ³1.

6 eo concilio dimisso] Caesar speaks of the dismissal of the assembly
without having previously stated that it was held3 he leaves his readers
to gather that from the fact that he had given the required permission
(ea re permissa). The curious brevity of this narration has led some to
suppose a lacuna after sanxerunt.

16 Aruernos] the Arverni occupied the district now called Auvergne.
, Tbey claimed to be of kindred descent with the Romans, cf. Luc. 1. 427
Arvernique aresi Latio se fingere fratres Ι sanguine ob Iliaco poculi.

potentatu] this word occurs but seldom. '

18 ‚Sequanis] the Sequani were clientes of the Arverni. In vl. 12
Caesar attributes to them the leading position here assigned to the
Arverni, ‘omnes civitates in partes divisae sunt duos cum Caesar ie}
Galliam venit, alterius factionis principes notit Arduigoltcrius Siquam 3
aud see below coactos esse (Aeduosl Sequaris obsides dure.
