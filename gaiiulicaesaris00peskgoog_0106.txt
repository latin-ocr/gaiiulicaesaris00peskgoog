18 supportaretur] the subjunctive is used because this is a subordinate
relative clause. supportabatur would have been equally correct, but
then the clause qui...supportobatur would have been an independent

‘assistance’ to the simple verb, eg. subuenire ‘to come to one’s assist-
ance’, supportare ‘to carry to one's assistance ¹, succurrere, suppetere,
submittere, subministrare etc: cf. subsidium.
