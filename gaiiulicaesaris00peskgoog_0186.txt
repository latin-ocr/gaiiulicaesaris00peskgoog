‘ouitable sor school use, has long been felt.

In order to provide Text-books for School end Examination pur·
poses, the Cnunnmon Utv1vnns1vannss has arranged to publish the
several books ot the B1BLE in separate portionis, at a moderate price,
with introductions and explanatory notes.

“The modesty of the general title of this series has, we believe,
led many to misunderstand its character and underrate its value. The
books are well suited sor study in the upper forms of our best schools‚
but not the less are they adapted to the wants os all Bible students
who are not specialistn We doubt, indeed, whether any of the
numerous popular commentaries recently issued in this country will be'
found more serviceable sor general use.”-Academy.
