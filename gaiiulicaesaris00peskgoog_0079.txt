54 Ι oa aucto carasco. [cona. 1.

4 perfacile factu] the supine in u is properly the ablative of a noun
of the fourth declensron, so perfacile factu: ‘ very easy in the doing’.

10 Galliae potiri] the only passage in Caesar where potiri takes a
genitive (Kraner). Possibly imperio should be inserted; see appendix..

Cure. a

13 paenam] poenam is the subject, damnatum the object, of sequi ,· nt
igni cremaretur is explanatory of poenam: ‘it was proper that the
punishment of being burnt should befall him if condemned’.

14 causae] this may be either genitive or dative. See note on concilio 30.
15 firmiliani] ‘household’‚ ‘establishment'.

16 clientes obaeratosque] the clientes were originally freemen who from
the pressure of debt or from other circumstances had surrendered them·
selves into slavery to the chieftains or nobles (principes). ‘The words
client and debtor are almost synonymous'. Ihne, Hist. 1. 110.

17 ne causam diceret] ‘to avoid standing his trial’.
ar sibi mortem consciverit] this is the usual term for suicide.

Cure. a.

24 ut exeant] this clause is explanatory of facere, and the nt may be
translated ‘namely to’: ‘they attempt to do that which they had de-
termined on, namety to quit their territory'. The idiom is of frequent
occurrence. Cf. Cic. de lege agr. 1. 9 quod homines sancti nmsacient, ut
pecuniam accipiant.

a 5 oppida] ‘strongholds': vicos ‘villages'.

28 domum reditanis1=domum redeundi: domum ‘homewards' is used
after the noun reditio as it would be aster a verb of motion such as
redire. This must be distinguished from such instances as quid ene
tactiost in Plautus where me is the direct object of the verbal notiou

implied in the noun tactio. Kraner qu. Cic. div. 1 68 reditum ac domum
taonem.

29 ffmt] for ut essent after comburunt cf. n. on 3 ut conaretur per·
su ct.

30 menseem] the form mensium is also used.

domo efferre] domo ‘from home' is almost adverbial, hence the pre-
position is not required ; cf'domo exire 6 and η, and contrast above e
finibus exire. Cf. my n. on 1v. 14.

31 Rauricis] the colonia Rauricorum subsequently founded by Munatius
Plancus was at or near Augst on the left bank of the Rhine‚ east of
Basle. The Raurici extended into Alsace. Desjardins shows from the
funeral inscription of Munatius Plancus at Gaeta that the spelling
Raurici is to be preferred to Rauraci.

Tulingis] the exact position of this tribe has not yet been satis·
factorily determined.

‘latebrg'oc‘sJ Desjardins places this tribe on the north bank of the
ΜΗΘ between Basfe and scheffhausen. -
