29 quod ba's...spatia] the mss all have ΧΠ for which on first thoughts
one would expect XXIV, and so Kraner reads; but I believe that Heller
has satisfactorily defended the vulgate. He says that Caesar is referring
to the flou· of the tide which continues for 6 houm, after which the ebb
prevails for another 6 hours and then the stood-tide recommences: thus
Caesar is correct in saying that in the space of ra hours the how of the
tide (aestus se ex alto incitans) is twice in progress: eg. supposing it to be
low water at ra uoon it will be high water about ὁρ. m., low water again
shortly after midnight; then at, say, 4 p. m. the tide will be flowing and
it will again be flowing at r or a a.m.; that is, it will be twice flowing
within the space of ra hours. Caesar thus emphasises the shortness of
time within which his operations had to be carried on, the enemies’
strongholds being inaccessible except at low water and the ships being
unable to navigate the shallow seas exceptat high water. Had Caesar
written xxlv he would, as Heller says, have been giving his readers a
piece of information which they must all have learnt at school, cf.
Heller in Philologus xxxl p. 53² sqq.

31 utraque re] ‘on both accounts’, ie. from the difficulty of attacking
whether by land or by sea ’.

32 magnitudine operis] ‘by the vastness of his works’: this is further
explained by the following exemeso etc, ‘as he expelled the sea by
means of adam and moles and raised them to a level with the walls of
the town‘. The following explanation of these works is given by
Napoleon after Gbler. “The Romans constructed at low water on the
firm soil (of the promontory at the end of which the town was situated)
two parallel moles serving at the same time as terraces and leading up
touthe town. During the course of their construction, the space corn·

the water could no longer penetrate, remained henceforward dry and
offered to the besiegers a kind of parade· ound, from which to attack”.
When the Romans had thus completed thlese preparations for attacking
the town by land the enemy brought up their ships on the seaward

side and removed themselves and their effects to anotheg strong·

hold.

quamvis] ‘any degree of force and violence'. contumelea is properly
contemptuous insolence displayed in manner or words, thence insolent
action, or insolence inflicted by one person on another, as in Tac. Hist.
111. 85 os offlm contumeliis where it is almost equivalent to‘blows’. Then
by an extension of usage it comesto be occasionally employed of the
violence exerted by inanimate objects or natural forces as here by the sea.
