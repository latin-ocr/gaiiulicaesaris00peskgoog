96 DE BELLO GALLICO. [Coun. 11.

16 sed] ‘but all their strength lies in their infantry’.

18 teneris...interiectis] I adopt Schneider's text, which Long follows,
and to a certain extent his explanation. The trees had their tops lopped
off when young (teneris); this made the branches grow out thickly side·
ways (crebris in latitudinem rancismate's), these branches were then iuter·
laced (inflexis. Schneider says inflexis, quad de binis binarum arborum
sibi adversis et in semet incurrentibus ramis accipiendum eandem segnifi-
canonem labet quaen implicatis sen implexis: the interweaving of the
branches oi two opposite trees cannot. at least be inferred from Caesar’s
account), the intervals were theu filled up with thornbushes by which a
compact and impenetrable hedge was formed. See appendix.

ao instar] instar is probably an indeclinable noun in apposition to
munimenta. See appendix.

ar nan mado nan] some editors omit the second nan. It should be
remembered that nan mado can only stand for nan macla nan when a
negative follows, as here nequciiem. Madv. on Cic. Fin. 1. 10.

enin. 18.

24 laec] it is generally agreed that the high ground between the villages
&titillatur{iitilritthlhtletssthtitllltutelli
ior the Roman camp. On the right or south bank oi the river between .
the villages of St Remi-mal-Beti and Louvroil is another hill named
aiter the village oi Hautmont.

27 acclivitate] as Mr Long says, acclivitas denotes the upward, declivitas
the downward, slope of a hill.

adversus leuia et contrarius] ‘opposite to this and corresponding to
it’. contrarius does not add much to the idea contained in adversus.

28 infimus] ‘at its base'. Caesar means, I think, that the slope was
bareos trees for the first ooo paces, not that there was an extent of
open ground noo paces in width before one came to the slope.

²9 introrsus perspici] sor perspici with adverb oi direction (introrsus
:introversus]‚ cf. 17 qua nan maala nan intrari sed ne perspici quidem
posset.

god glans] a considerable part of the hill is still occupied by the Bois
u uesnoy.

3¹ stationes] ‘outposts’, ‘videttes'.
32 videbantur] a true passive of videa, ‘were seen'.

Cure. 19.

p.42· r ratiaardaqne] ‘general method and arrangement ', ci. aa rei
militaris ratio atque orda. ,

aliter ac Belgae detulerant] ‘different from what the Belgae had
told ’, ‘different from the description given oi it by the Belgae ³.

r haste] see appendix.
