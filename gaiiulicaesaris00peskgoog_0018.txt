PREFACE. ’

ΙΝ addition to the books that I have elsewhere had
occasion to mention as of great use to an editor os
Caesar, I have now to record no slight obligations to ·
the magnificent work entitled “ Geographie historique
et administrative de la Gaule Romaine” by M. Ernest

Desjardins. An important contribution to Keltic
history will be found in Johann Gustav Cuno’s “ Vor-

geschichte Rom5,’' erster Theil, “dle Kelten.”

The two maps accompanying this edition are
taken on an abridged scale from Napoleon's Atlas,
I have added no special plans but have endeavoured
’ to make my notes sufficiently explanatory to enable
a careful reader'to construet for himself a rough
sketch of the principal localities mentioned in the

first two books,
