104 DE BELLO GALLICO. [couu.11‚

ao amnibus Gallis] all the Gauls without exception, whether Belgae,
Celtae or Aquitani. plerumque ‘as a rule’: sor plenamque omnebus
Schneider, qu. v. 57, equites plenamque amnes.

aa in neura se passe] Caesar, as Long remarks, seems to represent the
Gauls as crying den'sively, ‘how are such little fellows going to list that
tower on to our walli' as though suggesting with some irony that the
only possible way of taking so strongly fortified a place would be to
put the tower on the top of· the duplex murus. See appendix.

Curi. 31.

a 5 lacuit] thi's is not for lanati runt, but is the participle.

existimare] se must be supplied, as also with the verbs permittere
and petere ac deprecari.

29 petere ac deprecari] petere is simply to make a request‚ deprecari is
to beg a person not to do something ; our ‘deprecate' does not cover
quite the same ground as deprecari: tr. ‘beg as a favour’.

pra...mansuetudine] the same phrase has already occurred iu ¹4·
30 audirent] =audimus, in or. rect. statunset=starrrer2s.
33 traditis armis] :si traderentur arma.

parserat] passe would have done equally wiell, cs. n. on 14 consuerint.

CuAP. 32.

p. 48. 5 siprius, quam] Kr. qu. Cic. de off. 1. 35 tum ei qui armis
paritis ad imperatarum fidem confugient, quamuis murum aries percus-
serit, recipiendi. Cicero would have been less rigorous than Caesar in
dealing with a besieged foe.

ιο saceredixerunt] ‘they said that they were doing’; facere must not
Rertsrffiffi as if it were facturas. imperata faeere is the regular term

12 muri aggeresque] murus is the wall of the apprilum, agger the Roman
earthwork which had been advanced up to the brrnk of the fosse: the
ἓῗῶετζνεὶἓὲοὶέξε space between the two was nearly filled up with the

Canu. ³8.

¹9 praesidia] they thought the Romans would remove the sentinels
from the uallum and castella forming the line of circumvallation, or that
at any rate a less vigilant watch would be kept.

21 scute's...intextis] as Kraner points out, it is not clear whether intextis
agrees with scutis and eac is to be supplied with viminibus, the meaning
then being ‘shields made of bark or woven out of osiers'‚ or whether
viminibus intextis is an ablative absolute, in which case tr. ‘shields
made of bark or by the interlacing of osiers’.
