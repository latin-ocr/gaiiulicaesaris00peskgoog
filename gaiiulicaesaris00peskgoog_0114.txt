Cirr. 4—7] NOTES. ’ 89

Crrrr. a.

3 Bibrax] as Caesar's camp is admitted to have been situated near the
village of Berry-au·Bac‚ the site of Bibrax must be sought at a distance
of 8 Roman miles therefrom. Goler places it at Beaurieux‚ a small
village about a mile from the north bank of the Aisue, and at about the
requisite distance from Berry-au-Bac; others, Napoleon‚ Kampen, eto,
prefer Vieux Laon, a small waste plateam about rr miles east of Laorr.
The latter view finds the most adherents.

4 cx itinere] ‘on their way’.

7 maenibus] maaria are ‘the fortifications' generally aad are therefore
virtually equivalent to the neurus mentioned immediately after: tatis
{limiam is an ablativa of place ‘the whole length of the fortifica·

8 coepti suat] cf. 1. 47.

resemblance irr use or appearance to a tortoise-shell received the name
of testudo. The manoeuvre is fully described by Livy xxxw. 39.

partas succendunt] I doubtfully follow Vielhaber irr retaining the
succendunt of the mss. He quotes vn. 11 Caesar agiomasportis suc·
, censis intromittit ; the reading also derives some slight confirmation
from the statement in 7 omnibus vicis aedificiisque quas adire poterant
incensis ,· if they set fire to so many other places it is only natural to sup·
ose that they tried to do so to Bibrax; that they did not succeed ru
lurning down the gates may be gathered from the fact that no mention
is made of the besiegers actually forcing an entrance. The present
tenses succendunt, subruunt may very well mean ‘attempt’ or ‘begin to
lire the gates arrd undermine the wall’. Kraner and Long read suc·
cedunt, and the former omits partas and aptly quotes Sall. Iug. 57 alii
succedereetmurum suffiderc. “ ’

ra nulla] the word is made emphatic by its position at the end oi the

18 Numidas] Numidae is a corruption of the Greek word Νομάδες
‘nomads ', ‘wanderers ¹, a title applied to certain roving tribes in North
Africa. Plin. v. 3 Numidia cst Masinz'ssae clara nomine Metagonitai
terra a Graecis appellata, Numidae aaa Namades a permutandis pabula,
