19 qui...patebant] ‘now they extended'. The clause contains an ex·
planatory statement os the writer and forms no part os the thought of
the Helvetii. We do not know in what direction Caesar intends his
measurements to be taken: from F ort de l'Ecluse on the Rhone to the
junction of the Aar and the Rhine is-{ast 180 Roman miles, and from
Fort de l’Ecluse to Bregenz on the lake of Constance is 230 miles
(Walckenaer ap. Long.)

The reasons assigned by Caesar for this migration of the Helvetii
seem inadequate. Cuno (Vorgeschichte Rorns;Thei11., die Kelten)
pertinently aslis how it is that the Helvetii do not appear to have corne
to any understanding with the Romans, their southern neighbours‚
before starting‚ whereas they did enter into negotiations with other
neighbouring peoples. He suggests that there may have been some
diplomacy on Caesar’s part which he thought it desirable to conceal.
Certain it is that their evacuation of their home and subsequent de·
{motion lest their country an easy and a valuable acquisition to the

ornans.

23 carrorum] carrus is a latinised form oi a Keltic word; it is the
English ‘car', which in Mandeville's Travels is spelt ‘carre'. (Pros.
Skeat, Etym. Dict. s. v.)

24 sementes facere] sementem facere is quoted from Cato de re rustica:
compare the proverbial expression: ut sementem seceris ita metes ‘as you
sow, so shall you reap'. Cic. de Or. 11. 261.

28 5nhlgsmcepitg ‘took upon himself'. Cf. Cic. p. Cael. 373 Verr. v. Ι
12; am.v. .

30 regnum] by regnum must not be understood an absolute or heredi·
tary monarchy. Caesar applies the term loosely sometimes to the usurped
authority of some powerful chiestain who was wealthy enough to maintain
a large armed retinue, sometimes to a recognised and ina certain sense
legitimate headship. Cuno thinks that there may have been a Keltic
word ‘rex’ or ‘rix denoting some kind oi authority. The word prin·
capatus is equally vague ; in vu. 4, as Kraner points out, it is distinctly
opposed to regnum as a lower to a higher grade of power. For more
information on the subject the student should consult Desjardins, Geo-
graphie‚ 11. 544 sqq„ and Cuno, Vorgeschichte Roms‚ Ι. 37 sqq.

33 Dumnorigi] his name is spelt Dubnorix or Dubnoreix on several
coins and medals.

p. 3. r Aeduo] the Aedui were a powen‘ul Keltic tribe dwelling between
the Loire and the Sabae. They were on terms of friendship and al-

liauce with the Romans.

2 ut conaretur persuadet]¹ persuasit! being an histo'rical present may
have an imperfect in the subordinate final clause3 contrast this with ‘s

persuadent Rauricis mproficiscantur.
