APPENDIX.

A utitur list οξ the chief sess of the Bellum Gallicum is given in an
appendix to my edrtron of Bks. 1, ΙΗ, to which 1 may here refer, merely

P. 1,1.1t‚ad biemandum so all the MSS. except that P has
gemundum: the words are obviously ont ol place here and Kraner

proposes to omit them. Perhaps they shouldbe inserted between cobor-
tibus and attribuit.

Ρ· 2. 1. 8, V T U C Barb. insert absentibus aller erunt: ὼε, word
is unnecessary‚ since detractis is to be taken with conpluribus singultatim
as well as with cohortibus duabus.

Ι hPi 2, 1. 20, P R Α Μ omit lis, so Kraner and Vielhaber perhaps
rlgriis, 1. 11. uss nostris, but in v. 33 all the uss agree in eum; in 11.

1². t, 1. 2, I follow Dinter and Heller (Philologus xxxw. 715) in
reading uidebat sor the villerot of the uss, which may easily have arisen
from the previous meresinerot.

P. 4, 1. 17, astersruurmtiL U H add commeatusque petendi.

aduentu from misapprehension of the construction( cl. Nipperdey ,

Quaest. p.66.

P. t, 1. 23, Ρ R Α Μ V T L U J have posse, uam Romanos neque·
The confusion may have arisen from the wor s Romanos and neque
getting transposed.

P. b. 1. 27, Frigell should not have omitted the words atque apererssimo
which have abundant sts authority: their omission in A M. is no doubt
due to ὁμοιοτέλευτον.

M, 1. 20, TU omit esse, solKraner as more in accordance with Caesar’s
usage, cf. Hermes 111. 375.

1³. 6, 1. 2, Τ U curiously have libertatis studiose incitari ,· no doubt
the words studiose incitari were originally an explanation ot' mobiliter
celeriterque excitari written in the margin, whence they ultimately crept
into the text and ousted studere.
