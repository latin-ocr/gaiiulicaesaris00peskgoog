que...poterentur.

(defuerit, ‘had found' suits the English idiom better) no time ’, etc. or
‘the enemy were so near that the soldier found no time’‚ etc„ in this

more coordinate words or clauses have to be stated, either (i) no con·
junctionis put as A, B, C, or (ii) each is connected with the preceding,
as A etB et C, or (iii) the conjunction is omitted with the first members

and queis annexed to the last as A, B, Cque: thus A, Bque et C would
be quite unclassical‚ at least in prose. R ᾗ raon.
