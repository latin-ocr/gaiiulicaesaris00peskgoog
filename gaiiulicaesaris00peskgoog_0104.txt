6 Aruernos ct Rutenos] the Ruteni occupied a district corresponding
more or less closely with the department of Aveyron. Their chief town
was Segodunum, now Rhodez, on the river Aveyron The campaign
here alluded to occurred in rar 13.c.; cf. Liv. Epit. 61 Q. Fabius
Maximus caesui, Panli nepos, adversus Allobrogas et Bituitum Arver-
norum regem selict'tcr pugnavit. cx Bituiti exercitu occiso milia CXX ;

diendus datus est, quia contro pacem videbatur ut in Galliam remitteretur.
decretum qnoque cst, ut Congonnetiacus filius eius conprehensus Romam
mitteretur. Allobroges in deditionem recepti. After slaughtering raooco
men and carrying away their king and his son the Roman people
forgave the survivors and abstained from imposing a tribute on them!
This battle appears to have been fought at Vindalium near Arignon.
Fabius gained the cognomen Allobrogicus in consequence of this victory.
Cf. Mommsen 111. Bk. 1v. c. 5.

8 neque in provindom redegisset] yet a part of the Ruteni dwelt
within the limits of the Roman province, for in vn. 7 Caesar speaks of
Ruteni provinciales. Cf. in particular Desjardins 11. 281. ne uc rede·
gissct=et quos non redegisset, quos having to be supplied lions the
previous quibus.

ra suis legibus uta] this is the usual phrase to express the condition of
those communities whose internal administration was independent of
Roman control, the liberae et immunes civetates: cf. vn. 76 quibus ille
pro meritis civitatem eius immunem esse iusserat, iura legesque reddiderat.
The corresponding Greek expression is absumpta. These communities
had not complete freedom of legislation3 they could only preserve such
laws, customs and institutione as were not opposed to the general lex, or
constitution given them by the conquerors at the time of their organisation
as a conquered district: this was sometimes expressly stated in their
constitution: ef. lex de Termessibus ‘acis legibus ita arama...qase
adversus bromlegam non fiat'.
