²4 DE BELLO GALLICO. [Contu. III. .

the Gallie ships were not usually propelled by oars; one must not however
assume with Kraner that no provision was made ior towers in case olneed.

th· pedalibus iu altitudinem trabibus] ‘consisting ol beams a foot in
tc ness . “

16 digiti pollicis] pollex is not connected with polleo as the Lexicons ²

assert but with porricio (sor the change of r to tes. polliceor to hold out,
by way ol promise) : pollex then means ‘the outstretched ', ‘the pointer’.
digitus and δάκτυλος are probably connected with δέχομαι from the root
δεκ, and the word therefore means ‘the holder', ‘receiver', as the
German Fiuger is connected with fougere ‘to seize’. The word pollex
would be sufficient by itsels without digitus.

17 alutae] skins prepared with alum (alumen).

18 bae]=rt boe quidem or atque bae (as in v. 15): ‘and these (were
used), either because of the dearth’ etc.

27 adigebatur] I write this for adiciebatur in obedience to Madvig, so
14 telo adigi: cf. 1v. ²3 note.

28 copulisJ‘grapplingirons’.
29 et se oerrto dedissent] see appendix.

Crine. 14.

p. 8. 4 paratissimae atque...orrrotissimae] ‘thoroughly equipped and
lurnished with every kind oi warlike appliance’.

5 portu] probably the mouth of the river Auray.

9 cognoverant] ‘they had (previously) ascertained', ‘they had learnt by
previous expetience’. cf. v. 8contendit ut eam partem insulae caperet .
quo cpm'mum esse egressum superiore aestate cognoverat.

ro turribus excitatis] ‘though they erected towers’: excitare is osten
used in this sense, perhaps with an implied notion oi hasty erectiori,
in which case it would correspond to our expression ‘to run up': cf. v. ,

40 turres excitantur incredibili celeritate ,· Β. C. Ι. 25 turres ardebat: in ’

the same chapter we are told that Pompey constructed similar towers
on his ships, ibi (ie. on board his vessels) turres cum terreis tabulatis

¹ erigebat easque uiuitis tormentis et omni genere telorum completas od opera
Caesaris appellabat.

tomen] ‘nevertheless'‚ following the concessive ablative absolute
turribus excitatis. ,

bar] for the form ol' the sentence (instead ol turres excitatas altitudo
...superobot) Kraner compares lv. rr quibus audites...eos dorm
remittit, v. 4 principibus convocatis bos...eoncilia'vit and elsewhere.

rr ex barbaris navibus] ‘from the quarter of’‚ ‘in the direction os the
barbarian ships’. Caesar apparently uses this phrase instead of the

simpler barbarorum navium l‘the hei ht of the prows of the barbarian
ships’; which is what he really meantiin order to avoid the ambiguous
double genitive puppium barbararum navium.

neque...et]so often in Greek obre...re.
