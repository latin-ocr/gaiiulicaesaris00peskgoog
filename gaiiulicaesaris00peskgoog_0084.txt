30 suga sc recipiunt] ‘betake themselves in flight', different from ex ·

p. 7. 1 Arar] the Sadne. In the fourth cent. it bore the name Sauconna,
afterwards Saogonna or Sagona, whence the modern Sadne. The ex-

4 transibant] Napoleon‚ with whom A. von Kampen agrees, fixes
their point of orossing at Trevoux, a few miles north of the junction os
the Rhone and Sadne. He makes their line of march aster leaving the
Pas de l'Ecluse pass through Culoz, Virieule-grand, Tenay, Ambe‘rieux.
Desjardins is disposed to put the point ol orossing higher up, near
Micon, on the ground that the Helvetii would not have ventured to
cross so large a river with six Roman legions occupying the neighbour-
ing heights (supposing them to have been encamped at Sathonay as
seems probable), and that, had they been so near to him, Caesar would
not be said to have learnt their movements by means of scouts.

7⁴ reliquam] in sense quite equivalent to relictam this usage of
reliquus is by no means rare. Cf. v. 52·

sunrise 'into four argillae (watches) ol varying length according to the
season os the year. Cf. nr.

pdlygpbinotfhrplption is implied: they went to the woods and hid thern·

12 Tigurinus] os the four pagi, into which the Helvetic state was divided,
Caesar only mentions two by name, the Tigurini and the Verbigeni (27).
Desjardins supposes that the other two were ‚the Raurici and the
Tulingi, cs. n. on 5. (Addenda.)

ἵ 14 L. Cassium] cf. note on 7.

16 sive inmortalium] compare Caesar’s allusion to the interference ol
heaven in human affairs in his answer to Divico 14. Mr Froude
perhaps goes too far in saying ‘His own writings conto'ssx soum

g-n.
