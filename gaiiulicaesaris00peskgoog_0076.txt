p.1. 1 Galliaomnis] ‘Gaul asawhole’, that is, the country from the
Rhine to the Pyrenees, more extensive than the modern France: the
provincia is of course excluded.

2 Belgae] the word is said to mean ‘plunderers’. We leam from
11. 4that most of the Belgae were of Germanic origin. They must be
regarded as at basis a Gallic people, but with much admixture of foreign
elements: the Belgian, says M. Desjardins, is the German grafted on
the Gaul: ‘Belgium has always been nothing more than a thoroughfare
(⁶ un pays de passage’) and always will be so ’. ·

Aquitani] the Aquitani belonged to the Iberian race; they are said
by Strabo to have differed in language from the Kelts and Belgae, and
to have resembled the iberi in appearance and in language. The political
divisiones Aquitania organised by Augustus, comprising the whole of
Gaul south of the Loire and west of the Province, must be distinguished
from the ethnographic Aquitania of which Caesar is here speaking3
the boundaries of the latter are the Ocean, the Garonne in its upper
course, Μ. Corbieres and the Pyrenees: the Bituriges Vibisci situated
in the angle between the Garonne and the Ocean, having Burdigala
(Bourdeaux) for their chief town, were not Aquitani. It has been
supposed that the prae-Keltic inhabitants of Britain were of iberian

3 Celtae] the terms Galli, Galatae, Celtae are used indifferently by

Belgae in their physical characteristics, the latter being tall, with light
hair and eyes and elongated shull, while the Galli were shorter, with
hair and eyes of a deeper hue and brachycephalous skuli.

7 provinciae] the exact date of the constitution of the province of
Gallia Braccata afterwards called Narbonensis from the town of Narbo
Martius (founded by L. Licinius Crassus, ac. 118) is uncertain. Zumpt
