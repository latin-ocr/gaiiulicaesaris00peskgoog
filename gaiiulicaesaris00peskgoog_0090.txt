5 Labienus] It was the forces of Labienus which Considius mistook
for Gauls. Caesar, though he had also taken up his position on a
hill (copias in proximum collem subducit) evidently could not see the

Ι and not the Gauls that occupied the hill in question.

30 iu colle medio triplicem aciem iustruxit] The four legions were
drawn up in a triple line along the side of the hill, that is, each legion
consisted of three lines, these lines being so arranged that the first
consisted of four, the second of three cohorte, and likewise the third.
The two new legions with the auxilia were placed on the top of the
hill. Napoleon‚ followed by A. von Kampen, has selected as the
locality ol the battle a spot where two hills of slight elevation are
separated by a valley, through which runs a small stream called la
Roche‚ issuing from the Aldne which flows in a westerly direction about
a mile to the south of the spot in question. On the eastern of these
two elevations, situated between the villages of le petit Marii and
le grand Marii, he supposes the six legions to have been Μελ, mu
