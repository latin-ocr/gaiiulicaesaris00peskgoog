Aquileiam] Aquilia, situated on the coast at the most northern
corner os the Adriatic in the district ol Venetia.

10 proximum iter] theroute adopted by Caesar has been much dis-
puted. Napoleon's view is that Caesar, after leaving Tutin, proceeded
along the valley of the Chiusone through the village of Usseau (Ocelum),
then across the Col de M. Genevre to Briancon and Grenoble on the
frontier ol the Vocontii, where he would have to cross the Isere, and

oblique structure ol the sentence.
