102 DE antro carrrco. [cona. 11.

A brief recapitulation os the chief incidents of this battle may be use·
ful. The two armies were encamped on rising ground on op osite sides
ο1 the Sambre near Maubeuge, the Belgae on the SE, the Romans on
the N W, bank. The Atrebates occupied the right of the Belgic position,
to one looking towards the river, the Viromandui the centre and the
Nervii the lest. The right of the Roman position (opposite the Nervii)
was occupied by the vnth and xnth legions, the centre by the vmth and
xrth, the lest (opposite the Atrebates) bythe txth and xth; the xmthand
xtvthwere in charge of the baggage·train some distance behind. The battle
began by the Roman cavalry crossing the river and engaging the Be 'c
cavalry. While these were skirmishing the Belgae caught sight ot' t e
Roman baggage-train appearing some way off over the erest of the
opposite hill: acting on a preconcerted plan they at once broke from their
positions‚ scattered the Roman cavalry, crossed the river and burst with
terrific lury upon the Roman legions on the opposite side. The latter, en-
couraged by Caesar, sustained the attack as well as they could. Soon
the 1xth and xth succeeded in driving back the Atrebates across the
river, crossed it themselves and attacked and actually occupied the Belgic

the whole of the front and leit of the Roman position was left un-
protected The Nervii seeing this divided their attack, their right
making an assault on the sront of the Roman camp, while their left
went to the lett ο1 the vnth and xnth legions (with whom it will be re-
membered that the Nervii were engaged) in order to take them on their
right and exposed flank (latus apertum). At this time the xmth and
xrvth were coming up behind at a rapid pace, and, besides this, Labienus
with the rxth and xth on the opposite bank, seeing the critical state os
affairs, hastened to recross the river. This double succour in front and
behind completely turned the day, and the Nervii notwithstanding their
magnificent bravery were utterly routed.

31 unum oppidum] Gbler has concluded with great probability that the
site ο1 this oppidum is tn be found on the hill Falhize, a steep and rocky
plateau on the north bank of the Meuse, just opposite the town of Huy
m the province ο1 Liege, about halfway between Namur and Liege and
close to the junction of the small river Mehaigne with the Meuse. This
hill, ο1 an oblong shape, is steep and almost inaccessible on the SE. and
SW. sides; on the NW. side the ground is less precipimus, being
broken by a sew ravines, while on the NE. the plateau, instead 0
terminating in an abrupt fall, has a gently-descending slope ior some
little distance, after which the ground again rises till it merges with the
range of hills covered with the Bois du Huy; the width ο1 this end
where the slope begins is about 230 feet3 this is a sufficiently near
approximation to the width of τοο teet given by Caesar. Across the
plateau are some slight earthworks, marking no doubt the lineos the

double wall tlanked hya ditch which the besieged constructed.
