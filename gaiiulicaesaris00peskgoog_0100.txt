Cirr. 39, 40] NOTES. 75

but means ‘their own (the soldiers') valour ' ς this is made quite clear by
the following tanus, which refers to ¹Caesar.

18 factum...aidebatur] it will be observed that in this sentence the or.
obl. almost insensibly passes into direct narration ; this is shown by the
indicative videbatur, with which contrast sublevaret in the following
sentence. uaster in Caesar's language is simply equivalent to Romanus,
and therefore its use here does not of itsels indicate that the actual words
of the speaker are being quoted.

aa servili tumultu] tumultusis used generally of an outhreak of hostili-
ties in Italy: cf. Cic. Phil. vr11. ¹altaque maiaras nostri tumultum
Italicum, quoderat domesticus, tumultum Gallicum quoderat Italtac
finitimus, praeterea nullum nominabant. The rising of the slaves
under their gallant leader the Thracian Spartacus lasted from 7 3-71
rac. Many of these slaves were German or Keltic captives ; hence
Caesar's remark that this tumultus had afforded the Romans an oppor-
tunity of becoming acquainted with the Germans and their mode of fight-
ing. Cf. Mommsen Hist. tv. 80 sqq.

quas] the relative refers to servas implied in the adjective servili; tr.
‘in the rising of the slaves whom ’, etc.

24 quantum...bam] quantum is, as usual, separated from its dependent
genitive ; cf. 34 quid...uegatii.
25 natgayarmas] the adjectives inermis and inermus are used indiscrimi-

· 29 qua] the relative, it need hardly be said, refers to salvati, not to the
nearer illarum. Caesar’s argument is ‘the Helvetii have often con·
quered the Germans‚ we have conquered the Helvetii, much more then
shall we conquer the Germans ’.

30 si quas] tr. ‘if any of you are disturbed hythe defeat and rout of
the GaulS, those persons (aas) can discover, if they enquire into the
matter, that it was when the Gauls were wearied out by a long cam·
paign (diuturnitate belli ) that Ariovistus after having for several months
fenced himself in amid entrenchments and marshes, without giving thern
a chance of attacking him, set upon them on a sudden when now despair-
inghof tqluccqqs and diaslpersed, and ouercame them by skilful strategy
ra er an yopenv our.

p. 24. 3 cui rationu] ratio is put in the relative clause, when, according to
our idiom, at least, it rather belongs to the demonstrative clause aaa
(ratione): ‘even Ariovistus can hardly expect our troops to be taken in
by a strategy which served his purpose (lit. ‘for which there was room’)
when employed against rude barbarians’.

5 qui suum timorem] the student should notice the impossibility of
literally rendering this very idiomatic sentence into English: tr. freely
‘those who made their anxiety about the corn supply and the difficul-
ties os the march a pretext for their fear'‚ or ‘those who construed their
sear into an anxiety about’, etc.

. 7 afficio] «fficium here seems about equivalent to pauitantia.
cum viderentur] ‘inasmuch asthey appear&
