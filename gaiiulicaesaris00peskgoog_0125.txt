Cnar. ab.

30 Caesar...pmsectus] the narrative takes us back to 21 where we read
atquem alteram (i. e. dextram) partem dem cohortandi causa pros'ectus
pugnantibus accurrit.

3² signis] apparently the colours of the several cohorts; see below on
signiferoque interfecto. '

33 ad pugnam impedimento] cf. n. on 1. 25, where the same phrase
occurs.

p.45. r omnibuscmturionibus] there were6centuriaeinacohort, each
commanded by a centuria

Ι signiferoque interjecto] it is concluded from this passage that every
cohort had a special signum, though the fact is not elsewhere mentioned
in writers before the Empire (Kranerlz cf. Nipperdey on Tac. An. 1. 18..
Each manipulus had a sigrium of its own, cf. Varro l. lat. v. 88 mani·
pulos exercitus minimas manus, quae unum sequuntur signum.

4 primipilo] the first centurion of the first cohort was called primipilus.
Baculus was not killed, as welearn from 111. 5.

6 deserto loco] ‘having quitted their posts’: see appendix. ab nouis·
simis ‘in the rear ’, so again, a few lines on.

7 neque...et] so in Greek οὔτε..,τε are osten used, ‘the enemy did not
cease...ana¹ were pressing '.

9 uidit] this, like the vrdz't in line 1, follows on ubi. The greater part
of this chapter from the beginning to uti possent consists of one long
sentence made up of a protasis ubi suos...submitti posset and an apodosis
scuto...uti possent, to which also belong the words Caesar...projictus at
the beginning of the chapter: thus the second uidit would have been
sufficient by itself, but the insertion of the first uidit makes the sentence
easier to understand.

10 gib novissimis militi] ‘from a soldier in the rear ranks’: see ap
pen rx.

13 manipulos laxare] ‘open ont the ranks of the maniples ’.

16 operam nouare] nauare originally gnavare means ‘to make known’
‘to exhibit'3 operam nauare, lit. ‘to exhibit zeal ’, may be translated ‘to
do one's best’: the word is connected etymologically with γιγνώσκω
and its kindred words, cf. ignama=clyuova Cf. Liv.v11. 16 firmiter in
acie operam navaturos. Tacitus with his usual audacity of expression
ventures on bellum nauare, Hist. v. a 5. ’

Cnar. aa.

18 septimam legionem] this was one of the legions on the right wing
exposed to the assaults of the Nervii.

20 conversa signa] cf. 1. 25. Caesar placed the two legions back to back,
as it were, so that they fronted opposite ways; hence the words converso
