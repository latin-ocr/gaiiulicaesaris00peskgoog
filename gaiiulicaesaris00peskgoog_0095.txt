70 DE BELLO GALLICO. [Coun. 1.

aa elc'entes] the Segusiavi, the Aedui Ambarri and the Aulerci Branno·
vices were clients of the Aedui.

p. 18. 6 quiesset] esset not erat because this is a subordinate clause in or.
obl, being a part of Divitiacus' speech. Iterat had been used it would
have shown that the clause was to be regarded as containing a paren-
thetical remark by the writer himself.

9 Harudum] the Harudes were situated between the Rhine, the
Main and the Danube.

10 diacus] ‘roorn'; sedes ‘settlenrents'‚ cs. below aliud darnieilium alias

Art. xrs. 26. hanc refers to the GauIS‚ illa to the Germans.

16 Admagetabrigaa] this name is variously written in the MSS. No·
thing whatever is known of the place. (Addenda.)

superbe et crudeliter] ‘with arrogance and cruelty'. Cicero speaking
of the last king of Rome says atque ille Tarquinius, quem nearbres uestri
nan tulerunt, nau crudelis, nan impius sed superbus laabitus estet dictus
(Phil. 111. 9), yet the two ideas are closely allied‚ cf. Liv‚ v111. 33 qrcan·
tum interesse inter moderationem antiquarum et navam superbiam erude-
litatemque.

17 onmia exempla cruciatusque] exempla=‘punishments’ regarded as
patterns or warnings to others; cf. Ter. Eun. v. 6. ar uterque in te
exempla edent. Caesar might equally well have written, and possibly
did wyite, emnia exempla emutatus, cruciatus being gen. sing. after
exemp a.

20 nan passe] se must be supplied as below with dubitare. Frigell
unnecessarily reads sustineri.

ar nisisi quid...auxiliz] lit. ‘except if there is some aid’=‘unless

there is some aid'‚ for this use of si aster nisi cf. Halm on Cic.
Phil. 11. ἓ 70 (ed. Mayor).

29 deterrere passe ne] cf. 17 multitudinem deterrere, ne frumentum
ccesserunt: queminus might have been used in place of ue.
