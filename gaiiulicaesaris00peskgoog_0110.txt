fect of repeated action like afferebantur.

4 dixeramus] the perfect tersenis more usual iu expressions of this
kind, as above, demonstrauimus5 cf. however 24, 28, 1v.a7. For the
statement in question cf. 1. r, with notes.

6 omni Gallea] all Keltic Gaule the abl. abs. is equivalent to si omnis
Gallia pacaretur.

10 ferebant] one would have expected ferrent aud below studerent and
possent, the verbs of subordinate relative clauses in or. obl. being usually
in the subjunctive, but Caesar is here gradually and as it were insensibly

ussing from or. obl. to or. rect, for it will be noticed that above quod
lhecause] is followed first by the subjunctive sollicitarentur but after-
wards by the indicative occupabantur.

ιι mobilitate et leuitate anime] Caesar frequently alludes to the fickle
character of the Gauls: with this passage cf. iv, 5.

13 conducendos] conducere is here ‘to hire’, in the next chapter it is
used in its ordinary sense of '‘gather together': the present passage
shows how easily the oue meamug passes into the other.

circumstances, cf. 1. 18 irnperio populi Romani.

its logical antecedent Q. Pedium legatum cf. 1. at qualis esset natura
montis...qui cognoscerent, misit.

18 Q. Pedium] Suetonius (Caes. 83) says that Q. Pedius was a grand·

sou of Caesar’s sister. Napoleon says that he was her sou and yet

refers to Suetonius as his authority. Mr Long thinks, ou chronological

grounds, that Suetonius is wrong and that Pediuswaskxhxaesnn. xxv, 1

was consul uc. 43 and died during his tenure eternae.
