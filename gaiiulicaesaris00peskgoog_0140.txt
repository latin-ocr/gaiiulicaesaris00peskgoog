THE third book of the Commentaries presents no
special difficulties In preparing my notes I have
had recourse to the various editions and books of

reference to which I have elsewhere expressed my
obligations. A map of Gaul accompanies this edition
taken on a reduced scale and with some alterations
from the Atlas to Napoleonâ€™s Histoire de-Jules Clrar.
