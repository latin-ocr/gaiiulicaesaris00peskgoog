says himself, he made forced marches (niagnis itineribus ad Ariovistum
contendit). In the present chapter he says that aster marching sor three
days he heard that Ariovistus was making for Besancon and was already
three days’ distance from suifines; by this expression Caesar apparently
means the third part of the territory of the S uani that* Ariovistus had
annexed. Supposing Caesar to have started om Tonnerre, a forced
march of three days may have brought him to the neighbourhood of

circino] circium (rtpnuor circle) a pair of compasses: see Ovid's

nodo ] uinxit ut, aequali spatio tutantium illis, {altem pars staret pars

neuter agreeing with flumen not with oppidum: tr. ‘because the river
Doubs surrounds almost the whole town as though drawn round it by
compassos.

inclosed between the two arms os the river is said to be 1620 Roman
ieet, a clear proof that M (mille) must be inserted in defiance of the Mss
which all agree in DC. TheMsell out after the maspetum. pedum

of the Germans. Plutarch Marius XI. says that the Cimbri were con-

ὀμμάτων. cf. Iuv.xl11. 164.

ιο mentes animosque] there is no difference here between mens and ani·
