u1 Vocatium et Tarusatium] we baveno means of ascertaining the
exact position os these tribes. Desjardins suggests that the Vocates
may be identified with the ciuitas Vasatica of the ‘Notitia Provinciarum'‚
and with the Vassei ot' Pliny who also mentions among the Aquitanian
communities a tribe of Basaboiates or Basabocates, the latter part of
whose name suggests the Vocates of Caesar. The Vasates appear to
have leit their name in Bazas a town in the department of Gironde.
The Tarusates are doubtfully identified by Desjardins with the Toruates
of Pliny with the suggestion that they may b'e the same as the Aturenses
os the Notitia, whose name survives in Adura (Aire) on the Adour in the
department of Landes It will be noticed that supposing this identifica-
tion to be correct the Vocates and Tarusates lic to the N. and S.
respectively of the Sotiates (Sos), a view scarcely supported by Caesar's
way of speaking oi them.

9 duplici acie] Crassus drew up his force in two lines instead ol in the
usual acies triplex. The auxiliaries which were usually posted on the
wings he stationed in the centre of the line, having no great confidence
in them, asis stated in 25.

15 obsessis...patin] commeatu interclusa expresses the means hy which
they ho ed to gain the victory, while obsessis uiis expresses the means
by which they would cut off the supplies: thus the two ablativos are not
co-ordinate. ‘They thought it thc saler plan to block the roads and so
by cutting off their supplies to gain a victory without any bloodshed'.
