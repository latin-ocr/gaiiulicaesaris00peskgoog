oo impune iniure'as tulisse] the student should notice here that iniurias
serre does not mean ‘to suffer wrongs', a meaning which the phrase
often has, nor ‘to inflict wrongs', a meaning which it never has, but the
words ienpnneferre must be taken closely together and mean ‘to go
unpunished for'. iniuriae here are, of course wrongs inflicted and not
wrongs suffered,

3² cestro movent] Napoleon thinks with great probability that the
Gauls, aster crossing the Satine, followed the line of the subsequent
Roman road from Lyon to Autun, which was no doubt only an improve·
ment of an old Gallie road. This route would take them through or

' near Belleville, Avenas, Cluny‚ and St Vallier, where it is supposed
that they quitted the Autun road and turned westward, passing through
Issy l'Eveique Remilly, etc. to Mont Beuvray‚ near which the decisive
battle was fought: cf. 21 sqq. Heller, however, with whom Kraner
agrees, follows de Saulcy in placing the site of the decisive battle near
Ivry and Cussy·la·Colonne about 16 or 18 miles ΝΕ. of Autun. In
this neighbourhood a number of graves have been found which from
various indications are judged to be those of the Helvetii who fell in the
battle. Heller makes the Helvetii quit the Sadne valley somewhere
above Micon (cf. 16) and march into the Charolais hill district, thence
north-eastward towards ivry, passing to the east of Autun. · See the
case fully argued by Heller in Philol. xlx, 557 sqq., xxva 657 sqq.
