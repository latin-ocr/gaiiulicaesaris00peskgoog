a duodecima] Caesar had at this time 8 legions in Gaul numbered from
vu to xlv inclusive.

Nantuates] from 6 we learn that the Nantuates were situated be-
tween the Veragri, whose chief town was Octodurus (Martigny)‚ and the
Allobroges, and therefore occupied the valley of the Rhone between
S. Maurice and Villeneuve. Hence it is difficuft to suppose that they
are identical with the tribe of the same name mentioned in lv. roas
bordering on the Rhine near its source: see nry note on that passage.
M. Desjardins suggests with some probability that the original tribe
may have been broken up into two portions at the time of the
rnigration of one of the four Helvetic cantons, the pagus Tigurinus;
cf. 1. 12.

3 Veragros] Octodurus (Martigny) was the chief oppz‘dnm of the
Veragri who appear to have been more powerful than the other neigh-
bouring tribes and to have occupied some of the adjacent mountain
region.

Sedeenos] the Seduni occupied the Rhone valley in the neighbourhood
of Sitten or Sion (Sedunum) where an inscription hasbeen found bearing
the words civitas Sedunorum. These three tribes here mentioned, to·
gether with the Viberi. formed the civitam quotuor vallis Poeninae of an
inscription on a monument at S. Maurice erected in honour of Drusus
son of Tiberius, who died ηιμ).-

5 iter er nnn] the ,Great S. Beruard route leadin from Martigny to
Aosta Augusta Praetoria Salassorum, founded agac.) by the Val
Entremont and the Val du Grand S. Beruard. By periculo Caesar
means danger from the lawless mountain tribes rather than the natural
perils of the route, though one can well understand that these were con-
siderable in days when there was no friendly hospice.
