ADVERTISEMENT TOTHE NEW EDITION.

THIS edition differs but little from the preceding.
A few corrections have been made and a few ad-
ditional notes have been written and mostly placed
at the end under the head of Addenda. I have
looked through the list of recent conjectural altera-
tions, proposed chiefly by H. Kraffert, W. G. Pluygers
and W. Paul, collected with commendable diligence
by Professor Eussner in Bursian’s Jahresbericht‚ vol.
XXVII. Some of them are hardly worth recording.
In very few cases have Ι ventured to admit any

alterations into the received text. A valuable re· Ι
cension of the Bellum Gallicum has recently (1882)

been published by A. Holder, giving a conspectus
‘of the more important MS readings, with an excellent
index verborum.
