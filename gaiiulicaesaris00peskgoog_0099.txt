legion; two of these were appointed to command the legion every two
months, during which time each exercised sole command on alternate
days. They were usually elected p'artly by the people and partly by the
consul. Caesar appears to have chosen his own tribuni, and personal
friendship, as we leam from the present passage, influenced his choice.
They were all young men of equestrian or senatorial rank. ·

praefictr's] the praefecti were officers exercising the same command
over the socii, the allied contingents, as the tribuni did over the legions r
every cohors of the socii was commanded bya praeflatus and every ala by
three praefecti. Mommsen and Marquardt, R. A. v. 377 sqq.

30 testamenta obsignabantur] at an earlier period soldiers were allowed
the right of making testaments on the field of battle, which were called
testamenta in procinctu. This right subsequently fell into disuse‚ and
Caesar replaced it by the testamcutum militare: ‘militibus liberam
testamenti factionem primus quadem divus Iulius Caesar concessit, sed ea
concessio. temporalis erat ’, ete. Ulpian Digest qu. by Prof. E. C. Clark,

stances were exempt from the customary formalities attending the testa·

moted from the ranks were brave and experienced soldiers.

called praefecti.

8 omnium ordinum centurionibus] ordo=centuria On this occasion
Caesar summoned all the 60 centurions of each legion, whereas it was
usual only to summon the primorum ordinum centuriones, that is, in
each legion, the ro centurions in command of the several cohorts, it being
usual to advance the highest in rank of the6 centurious of each cohort to
the command of the eohort itself.
