march ’. It is suggested by Schneider that Caesar only reached the
boundaries of the Suessiones ou the first day, and then on the following
day hastened (contendit) to Noviodunum, and that the magnum iter
refers to the first stage of the journey from Berry to the border line
of the Suessiones; but, as Mr Long points out, this interpretation seems
scarcely to accord with the words of the text.

8 Noviodunum] two other places of this name are mentioned iu the
B. G, cf. vu. 12, 55. Itis generally supposed that our Noviodunum
occupied the site of the town of Soissons though Desjardins hesitates
to affirm this: M. Peigne-Delacourt places it at Noyon where there
are clear traces of a Gaulish oppidum, but the distance ol this place
from Berry·au·Bac, between 40 and 50 Roman miles, adds greatly to
the difficulties of the narrative; besides as Desjardins says, Caesar
would in that case have mentioned the passage of the Oise. The
Suessiones had ra oppido and it is probable that more than one of these
may have been named Noviodunum which appears to be equivalent
to the name now so common iu this part of France ‘Neul·cbateau’;
cf. such widespread names as Neapolis, Newtown‚ Newton, Neuville,
Neustadt‚ etc.

ex itinere] ex seems to denote here the immediate sequence of the
events; no sooner was the march ended than the siege began.

9 vacuum ab defensoribus] this usage is also found iu Cicero aud
Tacitus, cf. B. G.⁴ 111. 1, B. C. 111. 3 spatium vacuum a bello.

ι aupictbat] ‘he was told ', probably on several occasions, hence the

ιο latitudinem fossae mun'que altitudinem] for this inversion of words,
called by the grammarians chiasmus from an imaginary resemblance

to(th{)introversion of the two lines of the Greelr letter X, cs. supra

ρααιὶἒιὼίὲκᾰιηίίὸκε] ‘though it had onlya few defenders’,a con·

rr carmi munitis] ‘having made an entrenched camp ’.

vincas agere] ‘to move up pentheuses’3 agere: ‘to advance’‚ ‘ push
forward’. For the construction os the vineae cf. my n. on vn. 1⁷·

12 comparare coepti] Soissons is about 28 miles from Berry·au·Bac.
It would appear from Caesur's language that he marched from Berry

to Noviodunum in one day and on his arrival found time to begin the ·
construction ot‘ his military engineS.

13 ex suga] the use of ex is similar to that noticed above in the phrase
ex irritem they stayed their flight and collected at Noviodunum. Gtiler
is no doubt right in saying that the fugitive Suessiones crossed the

river tapd entered the town on the north side which Caesar had not

14 aggere iacto] ‘an earthwork having been constructed’: compare a

sirpilard utse of tacere in the common phrase r'acm fundamenta ‘to lau
