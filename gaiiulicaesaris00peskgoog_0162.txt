ness of the Gallic character. The word repentinus is well illustrated
in Lewis and Short. For the structure of the sentence cf. Tac. An. 1. 28
ut sunt mobiles ad superstitionem perculsae semel mentes ‘with the usual
proueness to superstition of minds once terrorstruck’: Cic. Tusc. 1. 108
permulta alio colligit Chrysippus, ut est in omni historia curiosus ‘with
his usual curiosity in all matters of history’.

31 per suos principes] ‘among their chief men’.

33 omnis] I take this to be sor omnes and not genitive agreeing with
fortunae though that would make good sense. Then for the position of
the word between eundem and exitum, cf. VI. 40 eundem omnes serorn‘
casum.

Cure. 9.

9 institui] ‘appointed’‚ comparari ‘collected’. Kraner points out that
it would be more difficult to provide a sufficient supply of nautae and
gubernatores than of remiges.

10 cum primum] Caesar was at Luca in April so it is probable that he
did not reach the army before May.

For the sanctity of legati cf. Dionys. Hal. xl. a 5 ἔστι δὲ πάντων ἱερώτα-
τόν re καὶ τιμιώτατον ὁ πρεσβευτής παρὰ Pauperiore, ἐξουσίαν μὲν ἄρχοντος
ἔχων καὶ δύναμιν, ἀσυλίαν δὲ καὶ σεβασμὸν ἱερέως and other passages
quoted in S. D. A. ‘legatus’.

18 multum confidebant] multum confidere occurs again in a 5.
¹9 concisa] ‘intersected'.

ro neque] the negative of course belongs only to posse not to confidebant·
neque posse confidebantaet nore posse confidebant.

αα oc iam...occiderent] ‘and even supposing that everything turned out
contrary to expectation’.

26 coruluso mari] such as the Mediterranean with which the Romans
were most familiar.

3¹ Osismos] the Osismi occupied -a district corresponding to the '

department of Finistere. The Lexorii have left their name in Lisieux
formerly Noviomagus in Normandy. The name of the Namnetes survives
in Nautes formerly Condivincnm. Nothing is known about the Ambili-
ati; they are provisionally placed by N apoleon on the S. bank os the
Loire below the Namnetes and the Andes. The Morini occupied N.
Picardy. The Diablintres were a division of the Aulerci and occupied

Western Maine: see my note on 11. 34. The Menapii were situated
between the Scheldt and the Rhine.
