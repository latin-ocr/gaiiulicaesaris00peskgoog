4 aerariae secturaeque] aerariuu ‘copper mines', secturae ‘cuttings’‚
‘diggings¹, ‘mines a ciel ouvert¹, Desjardins, who thinks that Caesar is
alluding to iron mines which are known to have been worked in Gaul
chiefly by the Bituriges, see the quotation in the last note. The Veneti
too seem to have had iron works‚ cf. supra 13 ancorae pro struibus ferreis
catenis restinctae.

9 Adiatunnus] M. Desjardins remarks that the Gallie name of this
king seems to authorise the conjecture that the Sontiates were a people
dwelling on the borders ol two ethnographically distinct groups, viz. the
IberoAquitanians and the Gauls: 11. 644 n. 4. The name should
perhaps be spelt Adsuntumnus.

ro soldurios] Nicolaus of Damascus quoted by Athenaeus Ἦ. 54 says
that these men καλεῖσθαι tet Γαλατῶν τῇ πατρίῳ γλώττῃ σιλοδούρους, τοῦτο
δ’ ἐστὶν Ἑλληνιστὶ εὐχωλιμαῖοι. Nicolaus flourished shortly before the
Christian era. It is not clear whether he derives his information from any
other source besides Caesar's commentary, or whether he is merely

and affection to their king, and lived and died with him, or whether
they consisted of pairs of devoted friends owning a general allegiance
to the king, in which case one might compare them to the sacred band
of Thebes. Tlm authority of Nicolaus, whatever it may be worth, and
general probability pronounce for the former view. Plutarch Sertorius
14 mentions a similar custom as prevailing among the Iberians to which
he gives the name of κατάστασις.

r 3 sibi martem consciscant] the usual phrase for suicide.

written cum sexcentis rimatis, but they are added by way of picking up
