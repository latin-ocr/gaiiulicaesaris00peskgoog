straight line. The distance following the bend of the river is, judging
from Baron Stofl'el's repon, 32 kilometres; hence Desjardins, who
corrects Napoleon’s error in saying that the distance, following the river
line, was 28 kilometres, errs himself when he says that the distance by
the river line is at least one-third more than the distance in a straight line.
Napoleon shows that there is no need to suppose the line of fortification
to have been continuous from the lake of Geneva to the pass: for
some distance the ground on the south bank is too precipitous to require

It has been conclusively shown by Napoleon and Baton Stoffel that by
neurus fossaque must not be understood a wall in the ordinary sense of
the tenn, flanked by a ditch, but by murus Caesar means simply the
scarp of a fosse, dug along the steep face of the hill; the scarp of such
a ditch would naturally be nearly or quite twice the altitude of *the
counterscarp. The whole extent which Caesar had to fortify is according
to Baron Stofsel 5000 matres: 3 miles 188 yards: this work might have
been accomplished in two or three days. Α, ²

17 alii vadis] the sentence would have been more regular if another alu·
had preceded navibus iunctis: ‘the Helvetu crossed partly (alu) by
rests, partly (alii) by fording’, but Caesar begins by saying that the
Helvetii crossed or attempted to cross by means of rafts and then asan
afterthought adds that some crossed by fording.

19 operis munitione] munituna would have done by itself ; aperis muni·
tione serves better to balance militum concursu. 'telis is not, I think, to
be connected with militum.
