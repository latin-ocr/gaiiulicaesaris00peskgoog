Care. 21-24] NOTES. 99

Canu. 2³.

29 acie] this is probablya genitive after parte. A. Gellius rx. ¹4 says
that Caesar in his book de onoloffla expresses his opinion that the geni-
tives die and specie should be used. cf. R. ξ 357. But orie might very
well be an ablative here ‘in line' ‘in their ranks '.

33 'transire non dubitaverunt] cf. n. on a dubitandum non existimavit
quin.

1). 44. 3 diversae] ‘apart from each other '.
4 ex loco superiore] to be taken with profligatis.
9 summam imperii] ‘the chief command’‚ cf. n. on 1. 41.
11 sunemum castrorum locum] the height occupied by the camp.

Cunr. 24.

13 quos pulsos dixeram] Caesar means ‘who aad been repulsed, as
Iliove said’ but by a slight confusion of thought and expression he
writes ‘whom I irad described as repulsed'. This, no doubt correct,

’ explanation of the pluperfect is given by Kraner and Vielhaber‚ cf. r,
28³1} 27 qltlcem densanstroverom praemissum ‘ who had been sent forward
as aves own.

¹4 adversis hostibus occurrebam] it would appear that before the Roman

cavalry who had engaged the enemy on the right bank of the river and
had been thrown into disorder and dispersed (19) could recross the river
and return to the camp, the Nervii had already crossed the stream lower
down and were attacking the camp on the high ground (summum cos·
trorum locum 23), consequently the cavalry on their return met (‘ran

' up against’ adversis occurrebant) the enemy who had crossed before
them.

15 fugam petebant] fugam petere, as Schneider shows, is more common
in poetry than in prose. Cf. Liv. rx. a 3.

calones] ‘suttlers' ‘camp-followers '.

16 decumano porto] the Roman camp was always constructed on definite
principles. It was in the form of a square through which ran the via
principalis terminating in the porto principalis dextro and the porto
principalissimam& the gates on the other two opposite sides were
called respectively the mcuniona and the praetorio porta. In the pre· ’
sent case the decumana porta was on the side of the camp farthest
removed from· the river. '

¹7 transisse consoexeront] ‘had seen that they had crossed ’.

ao qui cum impedimentis veniebant] it will be remembered that the
impedimenta were coming up under the convoy of the two recently
levied legions the xrrrth and xrvth; it was when they first appeared in
sight that the enemy began their attack, 19.

aa quorum...sa'nguloiis] ‘whose valour is in high repnte among the.
Gauls’ z cf. 8 propter eximiam opinionem virtutis. 1
