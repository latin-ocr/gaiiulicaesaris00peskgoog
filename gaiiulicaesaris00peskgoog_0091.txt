from the western elevation (marked in the map la Garde Chateau)‚
drove the cavalry across the brook and advanced up to the Roman
lines, sub primam nostram acc'cm successerunt. A. v. Kampen places
the carri and impedimenta of the enemy on another slight elevation
north os la Garde Chateau. Between these two hills and over the
hill on which he supposes the Romans to have taken their stand runs
an old road leading to Bibracte. De Sanlcy and Heller (as before
stated in n. on 15) consider the battle to have been fought between
Ivry and Cussy. Ι have thought it right to state the views of
Napoleon, Kampen, and others on the subject of this and other local·
ines, though one sometimes leels inclined to agree with the observations
of M. Desjardins on the extreme uncertainty, if not the inutility, of these
topographical identifications when they rest on such slender data as
Caesar here condescends to give us.

irou head was of the same length, but this extended half way down the
slralt to which it was attached with extreme care, so that the whole
length of the weapon was about 6ft. 9in.’ S.D. A. The head which
seems to have sometimes terminated in a barbed point was sufficiently
flexible to bend in piercing the shield or armour of the soe, which
rendered it difficult to extricate. The first rank of the Helvetian
phalanx covered themselves in front with their shields‚ while the hinder
ranks probably held theirs in a slanting position over their heads; it
would thus be easy lor the pilum when strongly thrown to transfix two
or more of these scuta.
