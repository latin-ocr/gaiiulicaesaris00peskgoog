ss ‘ nn narro ccciccc. [coni. 1. ι

ra quisi iuvissent] Madvig Adv. 11. 446 proposes to write qni iuvissent
on the ground that qni is unnecessary in a hypothetical enuntiation such
assi iuvissent, but Kraner compares 44 qui nisi decedat...scse ilium non
pro amico scd inste habiturum. The omrssion of cos or illos, the object
of habiturum, should be noticed ; in the passage just quoted from 44, the
object illum is inserted.

Crini. 2⁷.

14 omnium rernm inopiis] ‘utter destitution'.

17 suppliciterque] ‘and in suppliant tones besought him with tears for
peace .

atquc...iussissct] one would have expected atque cum is iussisset.

19 1 hcto] that is, to Tonnerre, supposing Napoleon's identification to be
rig .

44 Verbigenus] one of the four pagi or cautons of the Helvetii: cl. n.
on ra.

Crine. 28.
49 sibipurgatz] ‘clear of blame in his sight’.

30 l inhiantium numero] in might have been omitted as in v. 47, and
esew ere.

1).16. 4 copiam facerent] ‘supply them with com': copiam facere wasa

common colloquial expression in the sense of ‘give an opportunity', eg.
Plaut. Capt. 742 nt milii cius facias conveniundi copiam.

8 petentibus Aeduis] this is probably an abl. abs, though it might be
taken as a dative after concessit.

ro quibus] quibus and the following quos had better be resolved in
translation into ‘and’ with the demonstrative pronoun‚ ‘and to them
they gave’...‘ and admitted them’.

in parem] ‘into a similar status of right and liberty as they enjoyed
themselves’. Kraner remarks that as the Helvetii are represented in
vn. 9 (end) as still dependants of the Aedui, the equalisation here
s oken of cannot have been bestowed on'them till after the rising of
ercingetorix. This then would be an argument in favour of the -view
that Caesar's history was not composed‚ or at all events did not receive
its final shape‚ till after the end of the Gallie campaigns.

CuAr. 29.

ra litteris Graccis] probably in Greek characters, but not in the Greek
language. Cf. v. 48. ·
