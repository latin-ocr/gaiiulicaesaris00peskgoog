Cirr. 40-43] NOTES. · 77

propius accessisti, idque me sine pericula facere passe caisano. se is
required twice in this sentence, though only actually expressed once:
‘ssre says) that he thinks (se existimare) that he can (se passe) do it ’‚ eto:

the se in the text is probably intended to go with passe, there are many
instances of its omission with a priucipal verb in or. obl. Cr. 17, 31,
etc.

11 ad sanitatem reverte] ‘return to a sound mind’, ‘return to one’s
senses’, cf. v11. 44 utfacinare admisso ad sanitatem reverti pudeat ,- vm.
44 ad sanitatem perductas. Bell. Alex. 44 cives ad sanitatem revocaret.

14 pertinacia desisteret] ‘ desist srom his obstinacy': pertinacia is usually
perseverancein a bad course, perseverantia perseverance in agaad course,
Cic. de Inv. 11. 1643 Varro de 1. Lat. v. 4 in qua nan debet pertendi et
pertendit pertinaciam esse: quad, in qua oporteat manere, si in ea perstet,
perseverantia sit: from Cic. Part..Orat. 65 one may gather that the dis·
tinction of meaning between these two words was osten discussed.

ar causa] ‘hindrance’..

f Gallorum equitatui] Caesar had' levied 4000 cavalry in Gaul&
c . r 5.

4 3 figis] this word depends ondetractise omnibns agrees with Galles

ea] ‘thereon’, that is, on the horses; cf. 51; V11.58'; B. C. 111. 44.

45 si qnid opus facta esset] cf. R. ἕ 1255, where the usage is discussed
more fully than rn Drager or Madvig. quid is probably an accusative.

46 lsemli irrellicule] ‘wittily enough': the word is said not to occur
e w ere.

bere might mean either ‘to degrade to the rank of cavalry ’, or ‘to
advance to the rank of equites ', which in earlier times, when the
ca‘valry consisted os equites Romani, amounted to the same thing, whereas

(cf. 40 end) they were degraded by being turned into a cavalry regimem,
while as legsanarii milites, which was their real position, they were

The soldier's wit seems scarcely deserving ol Caesar’s commendation.

30 planities] it is agreed by Napoleon and A. v. Kampen that this is
in all probability tbe open ground near Cemay (Sennheim), a town in
Elaias, situated on the Thur, a small affluent of the lll, between the
latter river and the Vosges, and at a distance oi eight or uine miles
from Miihlhausen. In this plain are several rounded hills (tumult)
which would answer the description given by Caesar. Kampen doubt·
