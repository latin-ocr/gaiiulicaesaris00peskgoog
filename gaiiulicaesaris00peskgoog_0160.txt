o ex loco superiore] from the raised earthworks of the Roman camp.

7 non niodo] for non modo non: the second non is only omitted when
a negative follows (as here ne quidem), and then only when the predicate

is common to both clauses. It would not be correct to omit the Ἀ

non from such a sentence as non modo non interfectus estred ne
levissinrum quidem uulnus occepit, where each of the two clauses has its
gipttlipccltapggrslicate. In the sentence before usfaeroltor dabatur belongs to

winter-quarters with one plan (but) saw that he had met with far other
issues'. The repetition os alius serves to mark the contrast; he had

saw on recalling the past that he had met with issnes widely differing
from the design with which he had entered winter-quarters’. The
reading videbatis preferable to mnenon see appendix.
